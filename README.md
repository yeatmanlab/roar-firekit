Welcome to levante-firekit! 

## Overview ##

Levante-firekit is the middleware layer between the Levante dashboard and server side Firebase functions.

It is purpose built for that task. It is open source, so if you want to borrow from it please feel free. But it isn't designed to be a package you can simply install and use.
